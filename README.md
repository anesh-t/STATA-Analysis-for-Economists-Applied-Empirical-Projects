# STATA Analysis for Economists â€” Applied Empirical Projects

This repository contains a collection of applied econometric exercises completed using **Stata**.  
Each project demonstrates how to manage, visualize, and analyze real-world data through modern econometric techniques used in applied economics and public policy research.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

The objective of this repository is to provide practical examples of how to use **Stata** for data-driven economic analysis.  
Through these exercises, key econometric methods are implemented step-by-step â€” from data cleaning and descriptive statistics to regression modeling and advanced estimation techniques.

This repository serves as a learning and reference tool for anyone interested in:
- Strengthening applied econometric skills  
- Reproducing empirical models  
- Learning the structure of Stata `.do` files  
- Building reproducible workflows in economic research
